/**
 * AgentAccess — create the REST application password for tooling, from the settings page.
 *
 * Ported from ajr-starter-core's Agent_Access (2026-08-24) so this site
 * showcases the starter stack — same hardening, this plugin's naming.
 *
 * WHY
 *
 * Every site needs an application password before external tooling can read or
 * write anything over REST, and that is otherwise a manual trip through
 * Users → Profile → Application Passwords with a hand-typed name that differs
 * every time. This puts a button on the settings page that creates it with a
 * consistent name, shows it once, and lists what already exists so a stale
 * credential can be revoked.
 *
 * ⛔ WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
 *
 *   - It does NOT create anything on activation. A plugin that mints a credential when it
 *     is switched on leaves a standing password on every install, including the ones that
 *     never wanted API access, and nobody reviews what they did not ask for. Creation is
 *     always a deliberate click by a logged-in administrator.
 *   - It does NOT create a password for another user. It creates one for the person
 *     clicking, so the credential can never be more privileged than the human who made it.
 *   - It does NOT log, email or transmit the password, and it never puts it in a URL — a
 *     query string lands in browser history, in server access logs, and in the next page's
 *     referrer header. WordPress shows a generated application password exactly once; so
 *     does this. If it is lost, revoke and reissue.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT IS BRIEFLY AT REST. The plaintext passes through a 60-second transient so it
 * survives the redirect to the settings page — on a site with no persistent object cache
 * that is a cleartext row in wp_options. Rendering the settings page calls
 * consume_new_password(), which deletes it. Expiry is not deletion.
 *
 * This is not a new security surface: it is WordPress core's own
 * WP_Application_Passwords API, doing what the Users screen already does. What it adds is
 * consistency and a single place to audit.
 *
 * ⚠️ Application passwords require HTTPS. On a plain-HTTP local site WordPress reports
 * them as unavailable, and that is a correct refusal rather than a bug to work around.
